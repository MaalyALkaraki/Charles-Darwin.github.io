How about you write some more looping code - this time for a temperature control system. I would like you to test a monitoring system that will turn on a heating controller when the temperature gets too low below (19 degrees Celsius). I've provided some outline code to get you started, and the solution is provided further down. The test only needs to run for 30 minutes."
